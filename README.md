# argosy-sigil

A native C helper library that derives the game-native serial / title ID
from a ROM file. Designed for applications that want per-game save and
state files instead of per-platform — pair a local save to the right
upstream game record by reading the platform's own ID out of the ROM,
not by guessing from filenames.

## What it does

You hand sigil a path to a ROM. Sigil reads the platform-native
identifier directly from the disc/cart binary and hands back:

- `title_id` — the canonical identity of the game (`ULUS10064`,
  `SLUS-12345`, `0100ABCD12345000`). Use this for matching game
  records, deduplication, RomM/IGDB lookups, UI display.
- `save_id` — **the literal on-disk save folder/file name the emulator
  will create.** Use this for any filesystem operation against the
  save directory. For most platforms it equals `title_id`. For PS2 it
  diverges (`title_id=SLUS-21731`, `save_id=BASLUS-217311`) because
  the game's runtime picks a `BA`-prefixed folder name with a per-game
  variant byte that is not derivable from the disc serial alone —
  sigil reads it directly from the BOOT2 ELF.
- `raw_serial` — the ID exactly as it appears in the binary, before
  any normalization (`ULUS-10064`, `SLUS_123.45`, `RZTE`). Mostly
  useful for logging.
- `usage` — how the platform uses `save_id` to lay out save artifacts
  on disk (one folder per game, multiple folders sharing a prefix,
  one file, multiple files sharing a prefix).
- `source` — `binary` if the ID came from the file content
  (high-confidence, lockable) or `filename` if it had to fall back to
  scanning the filename for a community-naming bracket pattern.
- `experimental` — `1` for extractors that haven't been validated
  against real-world samples (PS3, Xbox 360, PSP-via-CSO at time of
  writing). Consumers should surface this to users so a low-confidence
  result can be flagged in UI / logs.

Persist `save_id` alongside `title_id` on your game record once you
extract it — `title_id` doesn't change, and re-reading the disc to
recompute `save_id` on every save sync is wasteful.

## What it isn't

- Not a hash-based game identifier. CRC32/MD5/SHA-1 matching against
  No-Intro / Redump / RetroAchievements is a different problem;
  hashing tells you "which dump is this," sigil tells you "what does
  the platform call this game."
- Not a save manager or sync client. Sigil tells you the ID; what you
  do with it (find a save folder, upload it somewhere, restore it) is
  on you.
- Not a generic ROM info library. Sigil extracts one thing — the
  identifier the platform's own save/state subsystem keys on. It does
  not give you region, language, version, hash, header dump, etc.

## Status

Pre-1.0. The API may evolve before 1.0. Every public struct has a
`struct_version` field so new fields can be added without breaking
existing consumers — but the function signatures and existing field
layouts can still change. Consumers vendoring sigil should pin a
specific commit; once 1.0 ships the C ABI freezes.

## License

MPL-2.0. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full text and
[TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md) for the project naming policy. Anyone
can use sigil in any application (proprietary or open); modifications
to sigil's own files must remain MPL-2.0.

## Supported platforms

| Slug | Platform | Inputs | `title_id` example | `usage` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `psp` | PSP | `.iso`, `.chd`, `.cso` / `.ciso` | `ULUS10064` | folder-prefix | `.cso` experimental |
| `psx` | PlayStation | `.iso`, `.bin`, `.chd` | `SLUS-12345` | file-prefix | |
| `ps2` | PlayStation 2 | `.iso`, `.chd` | `SLUS-20675` | folder-exact | |
| `ps3` | PlayStation 3 | game folder (recursive) or `.sfo` | `BLUS31426` | folder-prefix | experimental |
| `psvita` | PS Vita | `.zip` (filename only) | `PCSE12345` | folder-exact | |
| `switch` | Nintendo Switch | `.nsp`, `.xci` | `0100ABCD12345000` | folder-exact | |
| `3ds` | Nintendo 3DS | `.3ds`, `.cci`, `.z3ds`, `.zcci` | `0004000000123456` | folder-exact | |
| `wii` | Wii | `.iso`, `.rvz` | `525A5445` (hex of ASCII gameId) | folder-exact | |
| `wiiu` | Wii U | `.wua` | `10143500` (last 8 of folder name) | folder-exact | |
| `gamecube` | GameCube | `.iso`, `.rvz` | `475A4C45` (hex of ASCII gameId) | file-prefix | |
| `xbox360` | Xbox 360 | extracted game folder or `.xex` | `414D07D1` (4-byte XEX title_id, hex) | folder-exact | experimental |

The slugs are stable and match argosy's internal platform identifiers.
The C API uses the `sigil_platform` enum; `sigil_platform_from_slug()`
converts strings if your binding accepts user input.

## `usage` — what to do with `save_id`

| Value | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `folder-exact` | One folder per game named exactly `save_id` | `Switch/saves/0100ABCD12345000/`, `PS2/memcards/Mc0/BASLUS-217311/` |
| `folder-prefix` | Multiple folders per game, all starting with `save_id` and a profile/slot suffix. Consumers MUST enumerate and bundle all matches. | PSP: `ULUS10064DATA00`, `ULUS10064SETTINGS`, `ULUS10064SAVE01` |
| `file-exact` | One file per game named with `save_id` | rare; emulator-specific |
| `file-prefix` | Multiple files per game, all containing `save_id` in the basename | GameCube GCI: `<maker>-<gameId>-<name>.gci` (e.g. `01-GZLE-Animal Crossing.gci`) |

Treating a `prefix` platform as `exact` silently misses every save for
that platform — sigil emits this classification so dispatch is correct
without you re-deriving it.

## Quick example (C)

```c
#include <sigil.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    sigil_result r;
    int rc = sigil_extract_from_path("/path/to/game.iso",
                                     SIGIL_PLATFORM_AUTO, NULL, &r);
    if (rc != SIGIL_OK) {
        fprintf(stderr, "sigil: %s\n", sigil_strerror(rc));
        return 1;
    }
    printf("platform=%s\n",   sigil_platform_to_slug(r.platform));
    printf("title_id=%s\n",   r.title_id);     /* game identity, persist this */
    printf("save_id=%s\n",    r.save_id);      /* on-disk save folder/file name */
    printf("raw_serial=%s\n", r.raw_serial);   /* as it appears in the binary */
    printf("source=%s\n",     r.source == SIGIL_SOURCE_BINARY ? "binary" : "filename");
    /* r.usage: SIGIL_USAGE_FOLDER_EXACT | _FOLDER_PREFIX | _FILE_EXACT | _FILE_PREFIX */
    return 0;
}
```

## CLI

A reference `sigil(1)` is built alongside the library. Useful for
spot-checks during integration without writing any code:

```sh
$ sigil /path/to/game.xci --platform=switch --prod-keys=/path/to/prod.keys
platform=switch title_id=0100ABCD12345000 raw_serial=0100ABCD12345000 save_id=0100ABCD12345000 usage=folder-exact source=binary

$ sigil "/path/to/Silent Hill Origins (USA).chd" --platform=ps2
platform=ps2 title_id=SLUS-21731 raw_serial=SLUS_217.31 save_id=BASLUS-217311 usage=folder-exact source=binary
```

Pass `--platform=auto` (the default) to sniff from the file extension.

## Switch keys

Switch NCAs are encrypted; extracting the title ID from a retail XCI
or NSP requires the `header_key` from a `prod.keys` file. Pass it via
the support struct in any of three forms — sigil resolves them in
this priority order:

```c
sigil_support sup = {
    .struct_version = SIGIL_SUPPORT_V1,

    /* (1) Highest priority — raw 32-byte key, for callers that
     *     already loaded prod.keys themselves. */
    .switch_header_key = my_header_key_bytes,

    /* (2) In-memory text blob — for sandboxed environments like
     *     Android SAF where direct file I/O is mediated. */
    .switch_prod_keys_text = prod_keys_blob,
    .switch_prod_keys_text_len = prod_keys_blob_len,

    /* (3) Path on disk — sigil opens and parses the file. */
    .switch_prod_keys_path = "/path/to/prod.keys",
};
sigil_options opts = { .struct_version = SIGIL_OPTIONS_V1, .support = &sup };
sigil_extract_from_path("game.xci", SIGIL_PLATFORM_SWITCH, &opts, &r);
```

If no key is provided, sigil tries the unencrypted-NCA fallback path
(NSPs / XCIs whose NCA filenames are themselves the 16-hex title ID).
This works for decrypted dumps and homebrew but encrypted retail
content will fall through to the filename source — set
`SIGIL_FLAG_FILENAME_FALLBACK` in `opts.flags` to allow that, or
unset it to fail cleanly.

## Platform-specific notes

**PSP — folder prefix.** A single game produces multiple sibling
folders under `PSP/SAVEDATA/`, e.g. `ULUS10064DATA00`,
`ULUS10064SETTINGS`, `ULUS10064SAVE01`. Sigil emits the 9-char prefix
(`ULUS10064`); consumers MUST enumerate every folder under the parent
that starts with that prefix.

**GameCube — file prefix.** Saves are `.gci` files with the
convention `<makerCode>-<gameId>-<internalName>.gci`. Sigil emits the
hex-encoded ASCII gameId (`475A4C45` for `GZLE`); consumers match
files whose basename contains `-<gameId>-`. argosy's `GciSaveHandler`
is a reference implementation.

**PS2 — `BA` prefix + per-game variant byte.** `title_id` is the ROM
serial (`SLUS-20675`). `save_id` is the literal save folder name the
game's runtime creates on AetherSX2/NetherSX2/PCSX2 — typically
`BASLUS-20675`, but some games append a variant byte (`0-9` / `A-Z`)
to distinguish save profiles, e.g. Silent Hill Origins =
`BASLUS-217311`, Ace Combat 04 = `BASLUS-20152A`. The variant byte is
not derivable from the disc serial; sigil reads it from a literal
string in the BOOT2 ELF. Always prefer `save_id` over reconstructing
a `BA`-prefixed name from `title_id`.

**Wii / GameCube — title ID is hex of ASCII.** The disc header
carries a 4-character ASCII gameId (`RZTE`, `GZLE`). The save form
is the hex encoding of those bytes (`52535445`, `475A4C45`) — that's
what Dolphin's NAND structure uses. `raw_serial` preserves the ASCII
form for human-readable logging; use `title_id` for actual save
lookup.

**Wii U — last 8 of 16-hex.** WUA archives carry a top-level folder
named `00050000<8 hex>_v0`. The full 16 hex is the formal title ID;
the last 8 chars are what the save system keys on. Sigil emits the
last 8 as `title_id`, the full 16 as `raw_serial`.

**3DS — `0004` retail filter.** NCSD program IDs not starting with
`0004` are filtered as non-retail (system titles, CIAs, etc.). Set
`SIGIL_FLAG_3DS_ALLOW_HOMEBREW` in `opts.flags` to disable the gate
for CIA/homebrew workflows.

**PSP `.cso` / `.ciso` — experimental.** v1 CSO with raw-deflate
blocks is decompressed transparently and fed to the standard PSP
extractor. v2 (LZ4) is not supported. Flagged `experimental=1` on the
result until validated against a real CSO sample.

**PS3 — experimental, PARAM.SFO scan.** Pass either the
extracted-game-disc folder (sigil walks up to 4 levels looking for
`PARAM.SFO`) or the SFO file directly. Reads the `TITLE_ID` string
(e.g. `BLUS31426`). PKG / encrypted-EBOOT inputs are not supported.

**Xbox 360 — experimental, XEX parse only.** Pass either the
extracted-game folder (sigil walks looking for `default.xex`) or the
XEX file directly. The 4-byte XEX execution-info title ID is returned
as 8-char uppercase hex (e.g. `414D07D1`). Raw GDFX ISO parsing is not
implemented yet — extract the disc contents first.

## Building

```sh
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

Default build includes every platform. Feature flags for slim
consumers:

| Flag | Drops |
|---|---|
| `-DSIGIL_WITH_CHD=OFF` | libchdr + lzma + zstd (zlib stays if CSO is on) |
| `-DSIGIL_WITH_CSO=OFF` | zlib-based PSP `.cso` / `.ciso` IO layer |
| `-DSIGIL_WITH_SWITCH=OFF` | AES-XTS + tiny-AES + Switch NSP/XCI/NCA |
| `-DSIGIL_WITH_WIIU=OFF` | WUA reader |
| `-DSIGIL_WITH_3DS=OFF` | 3DS NCSD + zstd-streaming variant |
| `-DSIGIL_WITH_FILENAME=OFF` | Per-platform filename pattern scanners |
| `-DSIGIL_BUILD_SHARED=ON` | Build `libsigil.so` instead of `.a` |
| `-DSIGIL_BUILD_CLI=OFF` | Skip the `sigil(1)` reference CLI |
| `-DSIGIL_BUILD_TESTS=OFF` | Skip tests |

## Bindings

- [`bindings/android/`](bindings/android/) — Gradle library module
  wrapping the C ABI for Kotlin/Java consumers via JNI. Used by
  argosy-launcher.
- [`bindings/go/`](bindings/go/) — cgo wrapper for Go consumers
  (Grout). `go test` against `/tmp/roms/roms/` passes for all 9
  platforms including encrypted Switch XCIs.

Additional bindings (Rust via bindgen, Python via cffi, etc.) can be
added under `bindings/<lang>/` — sigil's small public API and stable
enum numbering keep these straightforward.

## Testing

```sh
# Synthetic unit tests (fast, no ROMs needed)
cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build

# Real-ROM integration tests — point at a directory with platform
# subdirs (psp/, psx/, ps2/, switch/, 3ds/, wii/, wiiu/, ngc/, psvita/).
SIGIL_ROM_DIR=/path/to/roms ctest --test-dir build -R integration

# Switch tests additionally need a prod.keys file
SIGIL_ROM_DIR=/path/to/roms \
SIGIL_PROD_KEYS=/path/to/prod.keys \
ctest --test-dir build -R integration_switch

# Cap samples per platform (default 25). Useful when iterating on a
# library with hundreds of CHDs per platform.
SIGIL_SAMPLE_LIMIT=10 SIGIL_ROM_DIR=/path/to/roms \
ctest --test-dir build -R integration
```

Integration tests skip cleanly with exit code 77 when env vars are
unset, so the public CI without ROMs can still run unit tests.
